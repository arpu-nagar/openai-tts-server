Gather items like paper, crayons, stickers, and old magazines for their storytelling toolkit. \n\nDetails: Give your child a theme or let them choose one they are interested in, like their favorite Bluey character or a recent family outing. Encourage them to craft a scene using the materials, and then ask them to narrate the story to you. You can enhance the experience by suggesting they use props from around the house, like toy figurines or even kitchen utensils. This activity promotes creative thinking and enriches vocabulary as they explain their DIY masterpiece."}
