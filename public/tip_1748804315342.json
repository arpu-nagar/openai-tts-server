{"id":"1748804315342","tip":"**Tip 1 for Engaging a 5-Year-Old in DIY Projects**\n\n**Create a Story Box**\n\nStart a fun and creative DIY project with your child by making a \"Story Box,\" which encourages both craft skills and language development. Here's how:\n\n*Actionable Strategy:* Find an empty shoebox and let your child decorate it with their favorite colors, stickers, or drawings of beloved characters—maybe even Bluey and friends! Once it's decorated, use it to store story prompts, like small toys, figurines, or simple pictures your child can draw.\n\n*Details on the Strategy:* Regularly, ask your child to pick an item from the story box. Encourage them to create a story using the item as inspiration. For instance, if they pick a figure of a dog, they can imagine an adventure where their favorite character from Bluey goes on an exploration with the dog. This activity not only boosts creativity and language skills but also gives them a fun, hands-on project that evolves over time. Plus, it’s versatile: they can add new items to the box from nature walks or craft sessions, keeping the storytelling fresh and exciting!"}
