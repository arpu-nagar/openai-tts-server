{"id":"1748830198001","tip":"Tip 1 for Parenting a 1-Year-Old: Engage Through Songs and Rhymes\n\nSinging songs and reciting rhymes is a delightful way to foster language development while keeping your 1-year-old engaged and entertained. At this age, children are fascinated by rhythm and melody, capturing their attention and helping them learn sounds and words. \n\nTry incorporating songs and rhymes into your daily routine, such as singing a gentle lullaby during naptime or a playful song during bath time. Use familiar tunes and add your child's name or favorite activities to personalize the experience. For example, you can create a simple song about their favorite toy or a character they know, like Bluey, turning it into a fun, bonding activity. \n\nBy consistently engaging with them through song, you support their emerging language skills, understanding of rhythm, and ability to communicate through sound and movement."}
