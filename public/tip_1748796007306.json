{"id":"1748796007306","tip":"Tip 1 for DIY Activities with a 1-Year-Old\n\nCreate a Sensory Bag for Endless Exploration\n\nCreating a sensory bag is a wonderful way to engage your 1-year-old's curiosity and develop their language skills simultaneously. Fill a durable, sealable plastic bag with various materials like colorful pom-poms, water beads, or rice. As your child explores the bag, encourage them to describe what they see and feel.\n\nDetails:\n- Attach the bag to a highchair tray or place it on the floor during playtime. \n- Guide your child by naming colors, shapes, and textures they encounter: \"Can you find the red pom-pom?\"\n- Use descriptive language and relate it to their interests. If they love Bluey, you might say, \"Can you find the pom-pom that's like Bluey's ball?\"\n- Adjust materials based on what captures their attention; if they show a particular interest in textures, focus more on varied materials.\n\nThis activity not only fosters language development but also provides sensory exploration, helping your child learn while having fun!"}
