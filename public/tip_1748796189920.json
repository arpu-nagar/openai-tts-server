Use safe, varied textures like soft fabric scraps, wooden blocks, and rubber kitchen tools. As your little one explores the box, encourage language development by narrating their actions. \n\nDescribe textures and actions such as, “You found the soft cloth!” or “Listen to the sound this spoon makes when you tap it on the box!” This activity will not only keep your child engaged but also help build their vocabulary and sensory understanding. \n\nTo adapt to your child's interests, if your little one loves a specific TV show or character, like watching Bluey for example, consider incorporating themed items or colors seen in the show to make the sensory box even more exciting. This way, you're combining their interests with learning moments, making the experience both educational and enjoyable."}
